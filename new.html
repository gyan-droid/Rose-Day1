          Happy Rose Day to the rose of my life. Even if I have to prick my hands on thorns, I will still hold my rose. 
          If I am a house, you are the garden that makes it beautiful. To me, even your fart smells like a rose. 
          Your smile makes me bloom, and you fill my life with colors.
          Like every color of a rose, you have filled my life with every beautiful emotion. 
          Your presence fills my world with love and care. 
          Thank you for being the fragrance of my life and the source of my admiration and inspiration. 
          Maybe I’m hard to handle, but take me as “tedha hai par mera hai.” 
          I will improve myself at every stage and always strive to be a better man for you. 
          I will hold you delicately like a flower and nourish you with love so you never wither. 
          Cheers to many more Rose Days that we will share in our lives. 
          P.S. I don’t know why I added the fart line — it’s just that I love everything about you😂.
